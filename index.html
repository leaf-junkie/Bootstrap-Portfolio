Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
    -  A navbar
    -  A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)
    eg. On xs and sm screens, content should take up the entire screen. On md and larger screens, 
    you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites 
    on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!
    -  Responsive images
BONUS
    Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site 
    (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)
